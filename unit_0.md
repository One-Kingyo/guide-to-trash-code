***All code segments are written in Java.***

## Unit 0

Even though you are trying to be a trash programmer, you still need to start from 0. It is still one of the trash rules for programming.
Here, we will teach you about how to write professional trash code.

### Trash yourself
First of all, trash yourself. Trashing yourself is simple and easy. Get yourself distracted, addicted to your phone, not willing to work, and forcing yourself to work makes the best trash conditions of yourself.

### Prerequires to Trash your Code
Here are the basic requirements to Trash your Code.

1. Open your least favorite text-editor, with completely no code-highlight or code auto-complete. The default Windows text-editor or the macOS text-editor would be a good choice.
2. Open a random music application on your phone, computer or whatever device. Play music that you don't like. A good one would be **Lost Rivers**.
3. Play the music at full volume with either speakers or headphones. **Shake your head so you get into action**.
4. Use your keyboard horizontally, and switch to your other hand using the mouse. This makes you feel good about yourself.
5. Create a file supports less encodings and characters. **ANSI files would be nice**.
6. Start writing trash code!

### Trash starts from naming

If we want to be really trash, then you'd better start it from the idea, start from the naming of your project. Give wide name to your code files, especially the one contains the main method. A good name can be "test", "run", and other random names for this. Remember, the most basic of all: **All of your classes shall starts with lower cases and go against java-naming methods, they are just traditions that need to be overcome.**

Use random method names, like a, b, c or something like that, this naming method can let you remember their order quickly and it's very simple to type in the code. Also, try to use as many same method names as what java already given us for, then we can overwrite it. *toString* is a good thing to use. We can also give the name *apple* to a variable which actually represents the value of banana.

When we name variables, we should use certain names and means differently in different local methods, this can make us only need type certain names and don't need to waste time for naming new variables. For example, we can gave the name *number* to variables in different methods, though it means different things in them in different cases.

Spelling is important, a misspell of term with randomly placed _ can be good.
For example: <br>
**DO**
```
String this_i_sa_go_ode_xample = "hello";
double f = 3;
int hiFellas = 2;
```

**DON'T**
```
int check = 5;
double average = 8.0;
```

**WARNING** <br>
These variable declarations are semi-trash, be careful to use them.
```
double avg = 3.03;
double cxk = 6.66;
String hlddz = "欢乐斗地主";
```
With all the naming methods above, we believe that you can give nice and confusing names for every variable, method, and class.

Next, we will start with trash code structure.

### Trash starts from coding strucutre

As a programmer, the best thing you could do is to have your code nice and neat, but as a *TRASH* programmer, the best thing you could do is to build your trash code from
the code structure.

So **what** is code strucutre? In short terms, code structure is how you structure your code, in other words, it is how you put the different parts of your code in your editor.
Structuring good code is easy, but strcuturing trash code is hard, so look out for the things that the things you normally do that makes your code good, not trash.

**Remember, we are making all code that we write trash, not good.**

Here are a few examples on trash and neat code structures.

**DO**<br>
```
public class Hello{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int x = 3;
    for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
      x++;
      int y = 1;
      y++;int hey = 2;
    }
    int hey = 3;while(hey < 1){
      hey++;
    }
  }
}
```
Notice how the different code segments mash up against each other? And how different decalration statements
are mingled with each other and placed in different places so things could be trash.

**DON'T**
```
public class Hello{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    int x = 3;
    int y = 1;
    int hey = 2;

    for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
      x++;
      y++;
    }

    hey = 3;

    while(hey < 1){
      hey++;
    }

  }
}

```
This code segment represents the worst code (in trash code terms) you could write. Declaring all variables in one section of
the editor, and separating them with whitespace is the worst thing you could do (Again, in trash code terms).

In the next up following chapters, we will guide you into the more deeper aspects of trash coding.
