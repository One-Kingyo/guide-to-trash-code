## Unit 0

Even though you are trying to be a trash programmer, you still need to start from 0. It is still one of the trash rules for programming.

Here, were will teach you about how to write trash code.

### Trash yourself
Trashing yourself is simple and easy. Get yourself distracted, addicted to your phone, not willing to work, and forcing yourself to work makes the best Trash conditions of yourself.

### Prerequires to Trash your Code
Here are the basic requirements to Trash your Code.

1. Open your least favorite text-editor, with completely no code-highlight or code auto-complete. The default Windows text-editor or the macOS default text-editor would be a good choice.
2. Open a random music application on your phone, computer or whatever device. Play music that you don't like. A good one would be Lost Rivers.
3. Play the music at full volume with either speakers or headphones. Shake your head so you get into action.
4. Use your keyboard horizontally, and switch to your other hand using the mouse. This makes you feel good about yourself.
5. Create a file supports less encodings and characters. ANSI files would be nice.
6. Start writing trash code!

### Trash starts from naming

If we want to be really trash, then you'd better start it from the idea, start from the naming of your project. Give wide name to your code files, especially the one contains the main method. A good name can be "test", "run", and other random names for this. Remember, the most basic of all: All of your classes shall starts with lower cases and go against java-naming methods, they are just traditions that need to be overcome.

Use random method names, like a, b, c or something like that, this naming method can let you remember their order quickly and it is very simple to type in the code. Also, please try to use as many same method names as what java already given us for, then we can overwrite it, *toString* is a good thing to use. We can also give the name *apple* to a variable which actually represents the number of banana. 

When we name variables, we shall use certain names and means differently in different local methods, this can make us only need type certain names and don't need to waste time for naming new variables. For example, we can gave the name *number* to variables in different methods, though it means different things in them in different cases.

Spelling in important, a misspell of term with random placed "_" can be good. 
Example: *this_i_sa_go_ode_xample*

With all the naming methods above, we believe that you can give nice and confusing names for every variables, methods, and classes.
