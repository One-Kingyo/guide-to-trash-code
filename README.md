## Welcome to the Guide of Writing Trash code

Welcome to Guide of Trash Code! 

In this website, we will guide you, through a series of examples, to write trash code, or turn your current code to trash. 
Here is a short example of trash code written by Java

```
public class Hello{
    public static void main(String[] args){
         String a = "H";
         String b = "E";
         String c = "L";
         String d = "L";
         String e = "0";
 
         String str = a + b + c + d + e;      
         
         System.out.println(a + b + c + d + e);   
    }

}
```
