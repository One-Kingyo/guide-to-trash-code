## Unit 1
The start of writing trash code

### Trash yourself
Trashing yourself is simple and easy. Get yourself distracted, addicted to your phone, not willing to work, and forcing yourself to work makes the best Trash conditions of yourself.

### Presequites to Trash your Code
Here are the basic requirements to Trash your Code.

1. Open your least favorite text-editor, with completely no code-highlight or code auto-complete. The default Windows text-editor or the macOS default text-editor would be a good choice. 
2. Open a random music application on your phone, computer or whatever device. Play music that you don't like. A good one would be Lost Rivers. 
3. Play the music at full volume with either speakers or headphones. Shake your head so you get into action.
4. Use your keyboard horizontally, and switch to your other hand using the mouse. This makes you feel good about yourself.
5. Start writing trash code!
